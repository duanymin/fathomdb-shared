Ideas for new format
(NOT IMPLEMENTED)

The problem is that we'd really have to update it in place.


Format V2 looks like this:

Header that describes the data in the file
Data blocks


The header gets 32MB out of 1GB, fixed (i.e. data starts at 32MB)

The header comprises a bunch of rows that look like this:

int128 md5
int32 scope
int24 startpos / 256
int8 unused
int32 length
int16 lastused
int16 flags

Each scope is typically a different website, and is a unit of trust.  Nothing can be served from one scope to another.
An MD5 collision can't occur across scopes.

The files are each data blocks that look like this:

int32 headerLength
int16 path
<N> path
<...> headerData

Data itself
